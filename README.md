# Loading-animation
Creative and attractive loading animation!!!
This short project mainly shows the use of "@keyframes" property of css and mainy other so that we can use it creatively in many big projects.
In this case i have tried to use this property to make an attractive loading spin.

About HTML used:
* Html used in this project is really short which contains only five extra tags except all the required syntactic tags.
* Out of these five tags four are used as wing of the loading spin. And the fifth tag is used for the middle part of the spin.

About CSS used:
* Most part of this project is about the use of CSS.
* Basic styling css like width, height, margin, padding, are used to adjust the size of different elements of the spin.
* Position and transform(rotate) attribute is used for arranging all the four wings at right positions and in right direction.
* Except aforementioned all the css is about @keyframes which makes the spin animated and lively.
